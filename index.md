### Hello
My name is Elad Rapaport. I am Israeli. I am a Data Scientist who lives on the connection between software development and Data Science. I believe that good software development practices should be employed in the research setting and hope I am a living example for this combination.  


### My Work and Interests
In my current work I deal with language models for code, for the purpose of bug finding. I employ and customize methods developed in Google Research and Microsoft Research, based on Transformers and Graph Neural Networks in real-world settings. The aim of this work is to capture critical bugs in early develpment phases to avoid high costs due to late discovery.

### My Education
I have a B.Sc in Software Engineering (with honors) and an M.Sc in Information Systems Engineering (fast track), both from Ben Gurion University in Israel.

### My Hobbies
I enjoy running, hiking, swimming, playing the guitar, and I also do some Improv theater :)
